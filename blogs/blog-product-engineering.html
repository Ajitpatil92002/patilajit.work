                <p>
                    In the modern tech landscape, the line between "Engineer"
                    and "Product Manager" is blurring. We are seeing the rise of
                    the <strong>Product Engineer</strong>—a developer who cares
                    as much about the <em>why</em> as the <em>how</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a long time, the software development lifecycle was a
                    game of telephone. Product defines requirements, Design
                    draws the UI, and Engineering builds it. This siloed
                    approach often leads to features that work technically but
                    fail to solve the user's actual problem.
                </p>

                />

                <h2>The Gap Between Code and Value</h2>
                <p>
                    A "Code Monkey" takes a ticket and closes it. A Product
                    Engineer asks: "Does this actually help the user?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I was building features for <em>Technosthala</em>, I
                    realized that writing the cleanest React component didn't
                    matter if the school administrators found the workflow
                    confusing. I had to step out of VS Code and step into the
                    shoes of a registrar managing fee collections.
                </p>

                <h2>Characteristics of a Product Engineer</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>User Empathy:</strong> You understand who uses
                        your software and the pain points they face.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Trade-off Management:</strong> You know when to
                        incur technical debt to ship faster and test a
                        hypothesis.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Data-Driven:</strong> You don't just ship and
                        forget; you look at analytics (PostHog, Mixpanel) to see
                        if the feature is being used.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Communication:</strong> You can explain
                        technical constraints to non-technical stakeholders
                        without jargon.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
                <p>
                    Companies, especially startups, crave engineers who can
                    operate autonomously. If you can take a vague business
                    problem—"We need to increase user retention"—and translate
                    that into a technical roadmap, you become indispensable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To transition into this mindset, start asking questions in
                    your next sprint planning. Ask "Why are we building this?"
                    and "How will we measure success?". The answers might
                    surprise you.
                </p>
